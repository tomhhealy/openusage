- Coverage provider: v8 (Vitest default).
- Test environment: jsdom.
- Coverage reporters: text, html, lcov.
- Coverage include: src/**/*.{ts,tsx}, plugins/**/*.js.
- Coverage exclude: **/*.d.ts, **/*.css, public/**, scripts/**, src-tauri/**, src-tauri/resources/**, src-tauri/icons/**.
- Tooltip disabled state uses TooltipTrigger render + span wrapper to avoid nested buttons while keeping hover tooltips.
- Mock/cursor lineProgress now always include unit/color fields to remove branchy conditionals (no change when values are defined).
- Mock plugin treats non-string mode as unknown; display uses safeString for visibility in warnings.
- Committed generated `coverage/` output per user request.
- Release version source-of-truth: Git tag `vX.Y.Z`; CI enforces `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` match.
- Auto-update interval picker placed above Plugins in settings for visibility.
- Auto-update countdown label format: "Next in Xm Ys"; shows "Paused" when no schedule.
- App updater state machine includes `installing` and in-flight locks to prevent double download/install; footer surfaces `error` as "Update failed" (tooltip via `title`).
